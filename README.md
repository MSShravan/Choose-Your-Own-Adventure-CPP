# Choose Your Own Adventure, A game in C++

In this project, a program that presents
a "choose your own adventure" story (CYOA) is implemented. A "choose your own adventure" book presents a
story, but you do not read every page in order. Instead, pages end with a
choice of where to go. E.g. a page might end with 

 1. If you want to try to sneak past the sleeping dragon, turn to page 47.  
 2. If you want to leave the dragon's cave and go home, turn to page 59.
 3. If you want to draw your sword and attack the dragon, turn to page 32. 

The reader then selects one of these options, turns to the indicated page,
and continues the story. 

For our purposes, the "pages" of the adventure will be provided in a single
directory as text files.  There will be one file "story.txt" which will
describe the other files in the story and the choices that lead from one
page to another.
